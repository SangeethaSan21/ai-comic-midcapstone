# 🛠 Workflow for 6-Panel Comic Creation (Flux + ComfyUI)

This document explains the step-by-step workflow I built in **ComfyUI** to generate a 6-panel comic page in one go.

---

## ⚡ Workflow Overview
- **Model Used:** Flux (base model for 3D-stylized consistency)
- **Character Training:** Custom LoRA trained with 30 images of Luna
- **Goal:** Automatically generate a 6-panel comic page with consistent character style and story flow

---

## 🔑 Key Components

### 1. **LoRA Loader**
- Loads the trained Luna LoRA on top of the Flux model.
- Ensures Luna’s yellow jacket, goggles, and face remain consistent across all panels.

### 2. **Clip Text Encode (6 Prompts)**
- I used **6 separate Clip Text Encode nodes**.
- Each one represents the text prompt for a specific comic panel (1 to 6).
- Example:
  - Panel 1 → Luna tinkering with orb + robot-cat.
  - Panel 2 → Close-up of goggles with orb reflection.
  - Panel 3 → Orb glowing brighter, Luna amazed.
  - … etc.

### 3. **Negative Prompt Encode**
- Shared across all panels to remove unwanted artifacts (e.g., “blurry, distorted, extra limbs, inconsistent jacket”).

### 4. **KSampler Nodes**
- 6 KSampler nodes, each connected to one Clip prompt.
- Generates the panel images individually while keeping the same LoRA character style.

### 5. **VAE Encode / Decode**
- Single VAE decode is reused for all panels.
- Converts latent images back into final PNG outputs.

### 6. **Image Grid / Concatenation**
- Instead of saving 6 separate images and pasting manually, I used **Image Batch + Image Grid** node.
- Automatically combines the 6 panels into a single comic page layout.

### 7. **Text Overlay (Speech Bubbles)**
- Used text/image overlay nodes to add dialogue directly into panels.
- Example: Jagged bubble for “Whoa—too bright!”  
- Comic-style font used for consistency.

### 8. **Upscaler (Final Step)**
- After concatenation, used **Latent Upscale** node to increase resolution (e.g., 2048×2048).
- Ensures the comic is sharp enough for sharing or printing.

## 📌 Output
- A single **6-panel comic page** featuring Luna.  
- Speech bubbles and dialogue integrated into the final image.  
- Resolution **upscaled** for clarity.

## ✅ Why This Workflow?
- **Automation:** Everything is generated in one go, no manual copy-paste.  
- **Consistency:** LoRA ensures Luna’s look stays uniform across panels.  
- **Scalability:** Can extend to more panels or even multi-page comics by reusing the same structure.
